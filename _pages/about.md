I am currently a first-year Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Stony Brook University, NY, USA](https://www.stonybrook.edu), advised by [Prof. Dimitris Samaras](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~samaras/).

Before joining SBU, I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science - Honors Program at University of Science, VNU-HCM, under the supervision of [Prof. Minh-Triet Tran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lt2ATkkAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Tam Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qIaGn7YAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Dr. Trung-Nghia Le](https://sites.google.com/view/ltnghia).

My research interests lie in Computer Vision and Machine Learning with focus on likelihood-based generative models and vision-language models.
